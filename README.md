# Pizza_Sales_Project
## Project Description
This project involves analyzing a pizza sales dataset using SQL to derive meaningful business insights. The analysis is designed to assist restaurant management in making data-driven decisions to boost revenue, optimize inventory, and improve overall customer satisfaction.

## Project Objectives
- Extract key business metrics and performance indicators using SQL.
- Answer practical business queries related to sales trends, peak business hours, best-selling items, and revenue contributions.
- Assist management in inventory planning, menu optimization, and marketing strategies.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL)
- DBMS: SQLite (can be easily switched to other DBMSs)

## Dataset Description
Dataset used: https://github.com/Nikita-Jatariya/Pizza_Sales_Project/blob/main/pizza_sales.zip
The dataset contains the following tables:
- orders: Contains order IDs and order date/time.
- order_details: Links orders to specific pizzas and their quantities.
- pizzas: Includes pricing and size details for each pizza.
- pizza_types: Describes the pizza category, ingredients, and names.

## SQL Queries 

Basic:
1. Retrieve the total number of orders placed.
2. Calculate the total revenue generated from pizza sales.
3. Identify the highest-priced pizza.
4. Identify the most common pizza size ordered.
5. List the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities.

Intermediate:
6. Join the necessary tables to find the total quantity of each pizza category ordered.
7. Determine the distribution of orders by hour of the day.
8. Join relevant tables to find the category-wise distribution of pizzas.
9. Group the orders by date and calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per day.
10. Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue.

Advanced:
11. Calculate the percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue.

## Project Highlights
- Clean and optimized SQL queries with clear naming conventions.
- Use of aggregate functions, JOINs, GROUP BY, CTEs, and window functions.
- Efficient use of date/time functions to identify trends and peak hours.
- Clear and well-documented code to enhance readability and reuse.
- Real-world business perspective aligned with data analytics best practices.
